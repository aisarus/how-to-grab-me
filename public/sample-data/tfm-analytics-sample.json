Describe specific sakuga techniques: smear frames, impact frames, anticipation, follow-through, exaggerated recoil, multi-frame blurs, perspective distortion for speed.\n*   Detail the choreography: Levi's agile dodges and precise slashes, Gabimaru's explosive attacks and counter-moves. Emphasize a back-and-forth exchange, near-misses, and powerful clashes.\n*   Include specific camera angles: dynamic close-ups on impactful moves, wide shots to show scale and movement, tracking shots following the characters, dutch angles for tension.\n*   Describe effects: sparks from blade clashes, dust clouds from impacts, elemental effects for Gabimaru's abilities, speed lines, motion trails.\n\n**Environmental Details:**\n*   Choose an environment that enhances the epic feel: ruins of an ancient city, a collapsing industrial facility, a desolate, stormy landscape, or a supernatural-infused battlefield. Describe key features (debris, structures, weather).\n*   Show environmental interaction: characters leaping off/crashing through structures, explosions altering the landscape.\n\n**Lighting, Color & Atmosphere:**\n*   Suggest dramatic lighting: high contrast, rim lighting, atmospheric volumetric lighting (e.g., shafts of light through smoke/dust, glowing elemental effects).\n*   Specify a color palette: dark, gritty tones with vibrant flashes of effect colors, or a more ethereal, supernatural palette.\n*   Convey the intense atmosphere: high stakes, desperate struggle, raw power.\n\n**Overall Stylistic Elements:**\n*   Reinforce 'anime style' and 'sakuga quality'.\n*   Mention influences like 'ufotable', 'MAPPA', 'Bones' (without directly asking for specific studio styles, but implying their level of quality).\n*   Keywords: hyper-detailed, intricate, cinematic, breathtaking, dynamic composition, masterpiece, 8k, ultra-wide shot.\n\n**Desired output:** A single, coherent, and highly descriptive stable diffusion prompt that incorporates all of the above elements, formatted as a continuous string for direct use in an image generation model.",
